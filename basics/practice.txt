These filters are attached to a stream using the stream_filter_append() function.
You can apply the filter to the read and write directions of the stream independently.

<?php
$handle = fopen("files.php", 'a+');
stream_filter_append($handle, 'string.rot13');
while (!feof($handle)) {
 echo fread($handle,1024);
}

You can provide a third parameter to stream_filter_append() to attach it to reading
or writing the stream.

The parameter is one of the predefined constants STREAM_FILTER_
READ, STREAM_FILTER_WRITE, or STREAM_FILTER_ALL.

By default, the filter is attached to
reads and writes
